# VMM
A Java implementation of a variable-order Markov model for [Cycling '74
Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max/).

This implementation is based on Francois Pachet's Continuator [1]. It allows
you to train models of note sequences and then play them back. There is a
comprehensive help file and an implementation of the Continuator included.

For more information on using Markov models in music, see [2] and [3].
